// Errorï¼š 2 
// for runAsync(1) will return a promise that resolves with 1 after 1 second
// for runReject(4) will return a promise that reject with Error: 4 after 4 seconds
// for runAsync(1) will return a promise that resolves with 3 after 1 second
// for runReject(2) will return a promise that reject with Error: 2 after 2 seconds
// since this is promise all and it will catch the error when there is one reject occurs, which will be the Error: 2

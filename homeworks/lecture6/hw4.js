 * \B: Matches a position that is not a word boundary, ensures that the match happens inside a number and not at its start or end
 * (?= ): positive lookahead that checks if a certain pattern follows, without including it in the match.
 * (\d{3})+: Matches one or more groups of exactly 3 digits
 * (?!\d): negative lookahead that ensures no additional digits follow
